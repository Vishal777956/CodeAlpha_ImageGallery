# CodeAlpha Image Gallery

This is my first task as a Frontend Intern at CodeAlpha. I made a responsive image gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


# What It Does

- Shows images in a grid that adjusts for big or small screens.
- When you hover over an image, it slightly zooms in.
- Click an image to open it bigger in a pop-up.
- In the pop-up, use “Next” and “Previous” buttons to move through images.
- Click outside the image or press “×” or “Esc” to close the pop-up.



# How to See It

1. Clone the Repo
2. Open the Folder  
- In VS Code, go to File > Open Folder and pick this project.
- Or in a terminal:
  ```
  cd CodeAlpha_ImageGallery
  code .
  ```
3. Run It  
- Right-click on `index.html` and choose “Open with Live Server” if you have that extension.
- Or just double-click `index.html` to open it in a browser.
You should see your gallery. 

# How to Add or Change Images

1. Put your image files inside the `images/` folder.  
2. Open `index.html` and find one `<figure>` block. Copy that block and then:
   - Change `data-index="0"` to the next number (0, 1, 2, …).  
   - Change `data-category="nature"` to the right category (for example, `nature` or `architecture`).  
   - Change `src="images/your-image.jpg"` to your new file name.  
   - Change the text inside `<figcaption>` to describe your new image.
